            <p>Hello and welcome to the COVID collision simulation. Our company has put in the effort to create a simulation that demonstrates how COVID-19 spreads.
                It's important to raise awareness of the effects of social distancing and show how dangerous it can be if you're not social distancing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before using our simulation please login first. The simulation has blue, healthy bubbles and red, sick bubbles. Some bubbles may move, some may stay still
                but it's up to you to change the speed, size and number of bubbles. See for yourself how COVID-19 spreads.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation is designed to help government official take the appropriate actions that helps ensure our safety.
                That doesn't stop anyone else from seeing this website. Everyone is free to visit our website so please share this site with your friends and family.
                Wash your hands, social distance and be safe!
